# GPT-2 Fine-Tuning Assignment

## Overview

This project involves fine-tuning a GPT-2 language model on a specific text dataset and exploring biases in the model's language generation. The project consists of two tasks:
1. Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model on a custom dataset.
2. Identifying biases in the model's output for different input prompts.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `transformers` library from Hugging Face
- `datasets` library for loading text datasets

### Install Required Libraries
